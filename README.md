## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open this folder in **VS Code** or your preferred IDE.
2. Use the folder structure to navigate topics you're studying.
3. Run individual `.java` files by setting their `main` method or compiling via CLI.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- VS Code with Java Extension Pack (recommended)
- JDK configured in your environment

## üìå Tips

- Maintain consistent package names (e.g., `package dsa_end_term;`) in Java files.
- Use meaningful class and method names.
- Keep code modular and well-commented.
